# Arxiv-Search

Arxiv Search is intended to provide a cleaner and more robust way of querying research papers on [Arxiv](arxiv.org). Pretty much the only motivation for this project was that I couldn't find an easy way to do advanced queries on the website, i.e. sorting by popularity.

At a high-level, this is done by cross-referencing data with other websites adjacent to Arxiv, like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), and [Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.com/) to determine the
